# Contributing
Your help is always welcome but please read the following.

## Pull Requests
All pull requests must first be made with an issue explaining what and why could be changed / improved.

This prevents both of us from wasting our time as most things don't necessarily require a pull request.

Please make sure your PR:
- Has been pre-approved via an issue
- Is short and focused to the point/scope. Large changes are highly likely denied.
- Is clean and readable.

Automaticly Denied PRs:
- Grammar corrections / Rephrasing / Removing empty lines
- Messy code (no offense)
- Anything not genuinely expected for a PR

## Issues
Assisting others in an issue is encouraged but please:
- Keep the issue on topic.
- Do not pretend to know. We all rather admit you don't.
- Keep things civil, hostility and edge-lording is an automatic ban.

## Documentation
File an issue if something could improved or added for any documentation.
